# Healthcare-Recordkeeping-using-Blockchain
Basic implementation of Block-Chain for storing and updating Health Records
-->We have two kinds of Users - Doctors and Patients
-->A transaction involves a doctor and a patient
-->For simplicity we have implemented zero knowledge proof for only patients
-->All the keywords, usernames used are case sensitive
-->Initially blockchain is empty
-->Atleast one patient has to be registered before adding or viewing a transaction
-->Operations should be performed in the following order (initially):
		register-->add-->view
